# Testing Instructions for Order Management System

## Issues Fixed: 
1. Action Buttons Not Working
2. Orders Getting Rejected After Payment
3. Incorrect Order Status Flow

## How to Test the Complete Workflow

### 1. Start the Application
**Option A: Using PowerShell (Recommended for Windows)**
```powershell
cd "Fronted/my-app"
npm start
```

**Option B: Using the PowerShell script**
```powershell
.\start-app.ps1
```

### 2. Create a Test Order
**Option A: Using the UI**
1. Go to the Supplier Portal
2. Click "Create Test Order" button in the Purchase Orders section
3. This will create a sample order with status "PENDING"

**Option B: Using the Test Page**
1. Open `test-order.html` in your browser
2. Click "Create Test Order" button
3. This will add a test order to localStorage

### 3. Test the Complete Workflow

#### Step 1: Supplier Accepts Order
1. Go to Supplier Portal
2. You should see the test order with "PENDING" status
3. Click the green "Accept" button
4. Order status should change to "ACCEPTED"
5. Action buttons should change to "Waiting for payment"

#### Step 2: User Pays for Order
1. Go to Purchase Hub
2. Click "Pay Order" tab
3. Enter the Order ID from the test order
4. Enter the amount ($0.50)
5. Click "Process Payment"
6. Order status should change to "PAID"

#### Step 3: Supplier Ships Order
1. Go back to Supplier Portal
2. Click "Delivery Management" tab
3. You should see the paid order in "Ready for Delivery"
4. Click "Ship Order" button
5. Order status should change to "SHIPPED"

#### Step 4: Supplier Confirms Delivery
1. In the "Delivery Management" tab
2. The order should now appear in "Out for Delivery"
3. Click "Confirm Delivery" button
4. Order status should change to "DELIVERED"
5. **Order automatically moves to Order History**

#### Step 5: Check Order History
1. Click "Order History" tab in Supplier Portal
2. You should see the delivered order with:
   - Order ID, Customer details, Total amount
   - Order date and delivery date
   - "DELIVERED" status badge
3. The order is no longer visible in active delivery management

#### Step 6: User Tracks Order
1. Go to Purchase Hub
2. Click "Track Delivery" tab
3. Enter the Order ID
4. Click "Track Order"
5. You should see the complete order progress with visual indicators

## What Was Fixed

1. **API Service Issues**: Fixed `updateSupplierResponse` function to work with orders instead of deliveries
2. **Missing Functions**: Added `getOrderById`, `updateOrderStatus`, and `processPayment` functions
3. **Error Handling**: Added better error messages and console logging for debugging
4. **Test Data**: Added ability to create test orders for easy testing
5. **Order History**: Added separate Order History section for delivered orders
6. **Order Filtering**: Delivered orders are automatically removed from active management
7. **Delivery Timestamps**: Added delivery date tracking for completed orders

## Status Flow (Fixed)
```
PENDING → ACCEPTED → PAID → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
```

### Key Fixes:
- ✅ **Accept/Reject buttons only work for PENDING orders**
- ✅ **Payment only works for ACCEPTED orders** 
- ✅ **Shipping only works for PAID orders**
- ✅ **Delivery confirmation only works for SHIPPED orders**
- ✅ **No more REJECTED status after payment**

## Troubleshooting

If buttons still don't work:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for error messages
3. Check the Network tab for failed API calls
4. Verify that localStorage has the order data

## Test Data
The test order includes:
- Customer: "Test Customer"
- Phone: "1234567890"
- Email: "test@example.com"
- Address: "123 Test Street, Test City"
- Item: "Paracetamol 500mg" - $0.50
- Total: $0.50
