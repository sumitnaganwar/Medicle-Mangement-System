# 🚚 Delivery Workflow Guide

## ✅ **Order History Functionality is Already Implemented!**

The system automatically moves orders from the dashboard to Order History after successful delivery. Here's how it works:

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow**

### **Step 1: Order Creation**
- User creates order → Status: `PENDING`
- Order appears in Supplier Portal "Purchase Orders" tab

### **Step 2: Supplier Accepts**
- Supplier clicks "Accept" → Status: `ACCEPTED`
- Order shows "Waiting for payment"

### **Step 3: User Pays**
- User processes payment → Status: `PAID`
- Order ready for shipping

### **Step 4: Supplier Ships**
- Supplier clicks "Mark as Shipped" → Status: `SHIPPED`
- Order appears in "Delivery Management" tab

### **Step 5: Supplier Confirms Delivery** ⭐
- Supplier clicks "Confirm Delivery" → Status: `DELIVERED`
- **Order automatically moves to Order History**
- **Order disappears from active dashboard**

## 🎯 **What Happens After Delivery Confirmation**

### **✅ Order is Removed From:**
- Purchase Orders tab (active orders)
- Delivery Management tab (out for delivery)
- All active order lists

### **✅ Order is Added To:**
- **Order History tab** (new section)
- Shows delivery timestamp
- Displays as "DELIVERED" with checkmark
- Includes order date and delivery date

## 🧪 **How to Test the Workflow**
